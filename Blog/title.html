		<h1>Five tips for front-end web development</h1>
		<p>NLP &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp stands for "Natural Language Processing". NLP is a field of computer science that deals with communication between computer systems and humans. This technique uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to create automated software that helps understand the human spoken languages and extract useful information from the data gathered from the audio.</p>

        <p>The techniques used in NLP allow computer systems to process and interpret data in the form of natural languages. It designs algorithms that can extract meaning from large datasets in audio or text format by applying machine learning algorithms. In other words, we can say that NLP is software that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to understand natural languages or the way human beings read and write in a language and extracts required information from such data.</p>

        		<li><h4>What are some real-life applications / real-world examples of Natural Language Processing (NLP)?</h4></li>
        		<p>Spelling/Grammar Checking Apps: Spelling and grammar checking applications are real-life examples of Natural Language Processing. These apps are mainly used in mobile applications and websites that facilitate users to correct grammar mistakes in the entered text rely on NLP algorithms. They also recommend the best possible substitutes that the users might type. This is possible because of specific NLP models being used in the backend.</p>
        		<p>Google Translate: Google Translate is the most famous application of Natural Language Processing. Using this, you can convert your written or spoken sentences into any language. You can also get the correct pronunciation and meaning of a word by using Google Translate. The Google Translate application uses some advanced techniques of Natural Language Processing to provide translation of sentences into various languages.</p>
        	
        		<li><h4>What are the most used NLP (Natural Language Processing) Terminologies?</h4></li>
        		<p>Following is the list of most used NLP (Natural Language Processing) Terminologies:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Preprocessing: This is a method used to remove unwanted text or noise from the given text and make it "clean." It is the first step of any NLP task. s</li>
        			<li>Documents: Documents are the body of text and are collectively used to form a corpus.</li>
        			<li>Corpus, or Corpora (Plural): It is a collection of text of similar type, for example, movie reviews, social media posts, etc.</li>
        			<li>Vocabulary: It is a group of terms used in a text or speech.</li>
        			<li>Out of Vocabulary: It specifies the terms not included in the vocabulary. We put the terms created during the model's training in this category.</li>
        		</ul>
        		<li><h4>What do you understand by Dependency Parsing in NLP or Natural Language Processing?</h4></li>
        		<p>In Natural Language Processing, Dependency Parsing is a process of assigning syntactic structure to a sentence and identifying its dependency parses. This is an important process to understand the correlations between the "head" words in the syntactic structure. That's why it is also known as syntactic parsing.</p>
        		<p>The process of dependency parsing becomes a little complex if there are more sentences that have more than one dependency parses. Multiple parse trees are known as ambiguities. The main task of dependency parsing is to resolve these ambiguities to assign a syntactic structure to a sentence effectively. It is also used in semantic analysis apart from syntactic structuring.</p>
